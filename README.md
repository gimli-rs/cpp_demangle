# `cpp_demangle`: a C++ linker symbol demangler

[![](https://docs.rs/cpp_demangle/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/cpp_demangle/) [![](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/cpp_demangle.svg) ![](https://img.shields.io/crates/d/cpp_demangle.png)](https://crates.io/crates/cpp_demangle) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gimli-rs/cpp_demangle.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gimli-rs/cpp_demangle)

This crate can parse a C++ “mangled” linker symbol name into a Rust value
describing what the name refers to: a variable, a function, a virtual table,
etc. The description type implements `Display`, producing human-readable text
describing the mangled name. Debuggers and profilers can use this crate to
provide more meaningful output.

C++ requires the compiler to choose names for linker symbols consistently across
compilation units, so that two compilation units that have seen the same
declarations can pair up definitions in one unit with references in another.
Almost all platforms other than Microsoft Windows follow the
[Itanium C++ ABI][itanium]'s rules for this.

[itanium]: https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html#mangling

For example, suppose a C++ compilation unit has the definition:

    namespace space {
      int foo(int x, int y) { return x+y; }
    }

The Itanium C++ ABI specifies that the linker symbol for that function must be
named `_ZN5space3fooEii`. This crate can parse that name into a Rust value
representing its structure. Formatting the value with the `format!` macro or the
`std::string::ToString::to_string` trait method yields the string
`space::foo(int, int)`, which is more meaningful to the C++ developer.

## Usage

Add `cpp_demangle` to your crate's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
cpp_demangle = "0.3.5"
```

And then demangle some C++ symbols!

```rust
extern crate cpp_demangle;
use cpp_demangle::Symbol;
use std::string::ToString;

let mangled = b"_ZN5space3fooEibc";

let sym = Symbol::new(&mangled[..])
    .expect("Could not parse mangled symbol!");

let demangled = sym.to_string();
assert_eq!(demangled, "space::foo(int, bool, char)");
```

### `no_std` Support

`cpp_demangle` may be configured for working in `no_std` environments that still
have allocation support via the `alloc` crate. This is nightly rust only, at the
moment, since the `alloc` crate's collections aren't stabilized.

Disable the "std" feature, and enable the "alloc" feature:

```toml
[dependencies]
cpp_demangle = {
  version = "0.3.5",
  default-features = false,
  features = ["alloc"]
}
```

## Documentation

[Documentation on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/cpp_demangle)

Example programs:

* [A `c++filt` clone.](./examples/cppfilt.rs)

  Install it locally with this command:

  ```
  cargo install cpp_demangle --example cppfilt
  ```

## Implementation Status

Work is ongoing. While `cpp_demangle` can parse every mangled symbol in
`libiberty`'s demangler's test suite (the canonical Itanium C++ symbol demangler
used by GNU tools such as `c++filt`), it does not format all of them
character-for-character identically. I'm working on fixing that ;)

Despite that, I believe `cpp_demangle` is fairly robust. I've been
running [AFL][] on `cpp_demangle` overnight and it hasn't found any panics for a
long time now (and never found any crashes -- thanks Rust!).
