default = ["std"]

# Build using the `std` library. Disabling this and enabling the `alloc` feature
# enables `no_std` support.
std = []

# Use collections from the `alloc` crate rather than from `std`. Combined with
# disabling `std`, this enables `no_std` support.

# Enable copious amounts of logging. This is for internal use only, and is only
# useful for hacking on `cpp_demangle` itself.

# Run all libiberty tests, even the ones that are known not to pass yet. This is
# for internal use only.

# Enable fuzzing support. This is for internal use only.

# DEPRECATED. Don't use these features, they do nothing.

# TODO: remove on next breaking version bump.
